### **Contributing to PYKILLER**

We welcome contributions to **PYKILLER** to help improve its functionality, security, and usability for educational and research purposes. By contributing to PYKILLER, you are agreeing to follow the guidelines and policies outlined below to ensure responsible, safe, and ethical development of the project.

#### **How to Contribute**
If you are interested in contributing to PYKILLER, here’s how you can get started:

### **1. Fork the Repository**
To begin contributing, fork the official PYKILLER repository (if applicable) to your own GitHub (or another platform) account. This allows you to freely experiment with the code without affecting the main repository.

### **2. Create a Feature or Bugfix Branch**
Before making changes, create a separate branch for your feature or bugfix. This makes it easier to manage your changes and collaborate with other contributors. You can do this by:

```bash
git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
```

For bugfixes, use a similar format:

```bash
git checkout -b bugfix/issue-description
```

### **3. Develop Your Changes**
- **Write Safe Code**: Ensure that your changes adhere to **best practices** and align with the intended use of PYKILLER (for controlled environments and educational purposes only).
- **Documentation**: If your change introduces a new feature, update the **README** or **documentation** to reflect this change. All new functionality should be documented for clarity.
- **Testing**: Ensure your changes are thoroughly tested in **safe environments** (e.g., virtual machines, containerized environments) before pushing them.

### **4. Follow Code Guidelines**
- **Code Quality**: Adhere to Python’s **PEP 8** style guide and ensure your code is clean, well-organized, and easy to follow.
- **Security Considerations**: Given the nature of PYKILLER, ensure that **security considerations** are taken into account to prevent unintended harm. For example:
  - **Do not introduce new infinite loops or processes** that could cause excessive resource consumption without user control.
  - **Implement safeguards** to avoid crashes or unresponsiveness during development.
  - **Limit resource consumption** (e.g., memory, CPU) where appropriate.
- **Avoid Malicious Changes**: Contributions should never introduce malicious code, backdoors, or unapproved features. All changes should align with the ethical guidelines provided in the project.

### **5. Commit Your Changes**
Once your changes are ready, commit them with clear, concise commit messages that explain the purpose of the changes.

Example:

```bash
git commit -m "Fix memory leak in memory_bomb() function"
```

### **6. Push Your Changes**
After committing your changes, push them to your forked repository:

```bash
git push origin feature/your-feature-name
```

### **7. Submit a Pull Request (PR)**
After pushing your changes, open a pull request to merge them into the main repository. This allows the repository maintainers to review your changes before they are merged.

### **8. Review Process**
- **Code Review**: All contributions will go through a **code review process** to ensure they meet the project’s coding standards and security policies.
- **Security Checks**: Given the destructive nature of the tool, all PRs will undergo additional scrutiny to ensure that no unintended harmful code is introduced.
- **Testing**: Contributions that introduce new features will need to be **properly tested** to ensure they don’t inadvertently affect system performance or cause crashes. Automated testing (where applicable) is encouraged.

### **9. Merge Process**
Once the PR is approved, the repository maintainers will merge your changes into the main branch. If necessary, the maintainers may ask for changes or improvements before merging.

## **Code of Conduct for Contributing**

By contributing to PYKILLER, you agree to follow our **Code of Conduct**, which includes the following principles:

### **1. Ethical Use**
All contributions should align with the ethical principles outlined in the **Security Policy**. **PYKILLER** is a tool meant for **educational and research purposes only**, and its misuse is strictly prohibited.

- **No Malicious Code**: Any contributions designed to cause intentional harm, damage, or unauthorized access will be rejected immediately.
- **Responsible Testing**: Contributions must be created with responsible testing in mind, and no code should intentionally disrupt or damage non-authorized systems.

### **2. Respectful Collaboration**
- Treat all contributors with respect. Differences in opinion or approach should be addressed constructively.
- Engage in discussions and reviews with the intent to improve the tool, maintain security, and foster a healthy development environment.

### **3. Transparency**
- All code contributions must be transparent and open. Document your reasoning for changes, especially if they impact functionality or security.
- If you are unsure about your changes, discuss them before committing to the project to ensure they align with the goals of PYKILLER.

## **Security Considerations for Contributing**

Given the nature of PYKILLER, contributors must be especially mindful of the following:

### **1. Resource Exhaustion Safeguards**
Any changes made to **memory-intensive features** or **high-CPU usage** functionality must include **limits** and **safeguards** to prevent uncontrolled resource consumption. This includes:
- Adding configurable limits for memory and CPU usage.
- Ensuring that any new functionality that might result in resource exhaustion (such as infinite loops, large surface creation, etc.) includes mechanisms to prevent it from affecting the entire system.

### **2. Ethical Usage Documentation**
All contributions should include or update the **documentation** to specify how to safely use the tool. If a new feature could cause system disruption, contributors must include clear warnings and usage instructions in the documentation, as well as a description of any safeguards that were added.

### **3. Security Vulnerability Disclosure**
If a contributor discovers a **security vulnerability** or unintended behavior in the tool that could cause harm, they must immediately report it to the maintainers. This could include:
- Vulnerabilities that allow for unintended system crashes.
- Issues that could cause malicious use or escalation of privileges.
  
The maintainers will investigate the issue, work to mitigate the risk, and release a patch if necessary.

## **Contribution Best Practices**

### **1. Keep Changes Small and Focused**
- Submit small, well-defined changes rather than large, sweeping changes that may be harder to review.
- Focus on one change at a time to avoid introducing multiple, potentially conflicting modifications.

 **2. Test Changes Locally**
Before submitting a PR, thoroughly test your changes to ensure they work as intended and do not negatively affect the system. Always test in **virtual machines** or **isolated environments** to ensure system stability.

 **3. Keep Communication Open**
Stay engaged in discussions related to your PR, especially during code reviews. Be open to feedback, and be willing to adjust your code as necessary to meet the project's standards.

 **Reporting Issues or Vulnerabilities**

If you discover a bug or security vulnerability in PYKILLER, please follow these steps:
1. **Report it** through the issue tracker on the repository (GitHub or similar platform).
2. Provide a **detailed description** of the issue, including any steps to reproduce the problem.
3. **Confidentially** report any security vulnerabilities to the maintainers before publicly disclosing them, to allow time for a patch to be created.

 **License**
By contributing to PYKILLER, you agree to license your contributions under the **[open-source license]** used by the project (e.g., MIT License, GPL). Please review the LICENSE file for the specific terms of contribution.

 **Conclusion**
Thank you for considering contributing to **PYKILLER**. We appreciate your dedication to making the project better while adhering to our ethical guidelines and security measures. Together, we can continue to develop a safe, responsible, and educational tool to understand the effects of resource exhaustion and system disruptions.
